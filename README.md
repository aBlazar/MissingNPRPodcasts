# All Things Considered Unofficial Podcast

This project includes a simple Sinatra web app that consumes the NPR API for the
All Things Considered program and reorganizes it into a podcast format. As
stated many times thorughout this document, and throughout the NPR API Terms of
Use, this software and its output are **for personal use only**. I am in no way
affiliated with NPR or the All Things Considered program.

Please read TODO before using this software.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official podcast! NPR makes a good portion of its money from
licensing programs like All Things Considered to member stations. Do not let the
existance of this code prevent you from both listening to All Things Considered
from your local NPR member station and contributing to that station.

If you don't have a "home" NPR member station, feel free to donate to mine:

* [WFYI (Indianapolis)](https://www.wfyi.org/pledgeNew/pledgeForm.php)
* [WFIU (Bloomington, Terre Haute)](http://indianapublicmedia.org/support/radio/)

Make sure you note the All Things Considered program in your donation.

## Acceptable Use

Please read the [NPR API Terms of Use](https://www.npr.org/api/apiterms.php)
before using this software. As stated in those terms, API content is for
personal use only. While this software can easily be deployed in a publically
accessible way, it is up to the user to comply with the API's terms and be the
sole, noncommercial user of the content. Anyone using this software must do so
using his own NPR API key, making any actions taken by the software or the users
of the software the responsibility of the registered API key holder.
